# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Overview

Using a simple calendar, I added day.js to allow a user to have the ability to save events in the local storage from 9am-5pm. Additionally, different colors indicate the time blocks of the past, present, and future.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.
